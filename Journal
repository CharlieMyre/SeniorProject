11/9  I have downloaded MySQL.  It took a while, so I was unable to really do anything with it once it was downloaded.

11/15  I took an hour and learned a bit about MySQL.  I still feel as though I don't know all that much, but I have a good start on 
what I need to do for wednesday

11/18 I created a VERY rough draft of my data model.  Now i just need to figure out how to do that stuff.

11/22 I created another rough draft of my data model.  This one should actually be a data model, unlike the last one.  I am feeling a 
lot better working in mySQL.

11/28 I created 4 example pages that I will use for my website.  The first page I created was the page used to add a game to the 
database. The second page I made was the page used to view the details about each game.  I then created the page to request games to 
be bought by the club (It used similar code to the add game).  Finally I created the actual db page.

12/2 I added 3 games to the database, which will be connected to my pages at a later time.  These games were: Risk, Dark Moon, 
and Monopoly.

12/6 I have made my comments in my journal more detailed.  I will continue to do this for the rest of my project.

12/9 I popualated my tables in my database.  They are now ready for testing.  Every table has been populated with at least a few values.

12/15 I wrote my to do list.
