11/9  I have downloaded MySQL.  It took a while, so I was unable to really do anything with it once it was downloaded.

11/15  I took an hour and learned a bit about MySQL.  I still feel as though I don't know all that much, but I have a good
start on what I need to do for wednesday

11/18 I created a VERY rough draft of my data model.  Now i just need to figure out how to do that stuff.

11/22 I created another rough draft of my data model.  This one should actually be a data model, unlike the last one.  I am
feeling a lot better working in mySQL.

11/28 I created an example of what my pages will look like.

12/2 I populated part of the database.
